# MySQLInsertBashScriptCreator
This is a quite simple script that I developed on my free time when creating test databases in MySQL.

It is designed to create a scheme so that a "replace" command from a text editor makes the task of inserting custom registries easier. The output will be something like:

INSERT INTO Alumnos VALUES
        ('Alumnos1','Alumnos2','Alumnos3','Alumnos4');
INSERT INTO Alumnos VALUES
        ('Alumnos1','Alumnos2','Alumnos3','Alumnos4');


When run, it explains the input format needed, and is avaliable in Spanish and English.
